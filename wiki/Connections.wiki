The orange wire carries the signal to the audio IN of your video Tx (black is ground only connected in one side)

Power from the lipo to the RAW pin of the arduino and also the ground (bear in mind common ground and ONLY effective connection to Ground -avoid ground loops-), the green wire brings the gps signal, in this case 9600bps, but you have to adapt t your gps unit change it in the code also).

Fixed to the TS with double side foam.
